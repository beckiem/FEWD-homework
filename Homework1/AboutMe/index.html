			<p>There are a few things you should know about me. My favorite color is purple, I've had a camera in hand since age 14, and I have a super cute cat named Penny. I work in technical support at great company called <a href=http://www.hubspot.com>HubSpot</a>. I like to explore new cities, snowboard, and laugh with my wonderful friends and family. So nice to meet you!</p>
